      a dcmitype:Collection ;
      dc:title "AustLit" ;
      dcterms:abstract "AustLit provides full-text access to hundreds of examples of out of copyright poetry, fiction and criticism ranging from 1795 to the 1930s. The collection includes literature intended for popular audiences as well as literature intended for audiences concerned with literary quality or the establishment of a national canon. The bibliographical information associated with these records enables researchers to investigate the relationships between texts and particular publishers or to track the first publication of each text in newspapers, magazines or journals. This provides indirect evidence of the original audience for each text and the evolution of reception over time if the texts were subsequently republished in other contexts. " ;
